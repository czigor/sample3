All three samples are taken from gulyakor.hu, a hobby project of mine related to relay trail running.

Runners use their mobile phones to demonstrate they have touched the checkpoints. They can do that by reading a QR code at the checkpoint or using the phone's gps capabilities to submit their coordinates. 

The implementation of this happened using the same pattern as commerce_payment uses for payment methods. The "PiliskorRead" Plugin handles the verifying logic (e.g. checking the phone gps coordinates against the checkpoint's) and there's a PluginForm to display a GPS button to press.

There's also an "Always successful" plugin for testing purposes.  

One difference from payment method plugins is that PiliskorRead plugins must also define a route to send the checkpoint information to.
